# SoftwareSystem-Assignment-1
Software Systems A - Assignment 1

Note:
I checked the program with the given tester,
The files seems to indicate to be different as the given files has EOF char at each end of file.
In addition, In the tester you mention 1 as a prime number although it's not - I added it to the n == 2 flag, this is wrong by any means but for the assignment sake.
